									<h2>My personal review</h2>
								</header>

								<br>

								<h3>What went well? </h3>
								Managing to include all the features I wished was a big success; Easy controls with an easy-to-understand UI, Animations, A map with wall
								collisions, a basic ghost AI, a win/loss mechanic, a high score, Good aesthetic as well as multiple sound effects. Implementing these was quite
								the challenge at times, and required several bug fixes and tests but luckily, I was able to use my previous knowledge from coding in JavaScript
								to conquer some of the hurdles.<br>
								<br>
								<h3>What didn’t go so well? </h3>
								The Pacman I created wasn’t as unique as I would have loved it to be; I put my own aesthetic twist in the mix by making the wall texture a Minecraft
								grass block, and by making pacman explode when you die, however, I would have loved to mix it up a bit by switching up some of the game mechanics more.
								For example, different enemies such as zombies or aliens, different collectable items like a speed boost or a random location teleporter, and maybe
								even different game modes for the game.<br>
								<br>
								<h3>What Would you do next time?</h3>
								If I was to make Pacman again, I would definitely add a main menu, where you can create or log in to a new account, open up a high score table,
								a customisation feature, different game modes, and a lot more. If I wanted to, I could create multiple game modes, and some could be multiplayer!
								For example, a game mode where you and the other players spawn in the same map and whoever eats the most munchies wins, the cherries turn you into
								a super ghost so you can eat other players as well as the normal ghosts for extra points, and the normal ghosts try and and kill the pacmen!<br>
								<br>
								<h3>One key area you felt you learnt a lot about?</h3>
								I definitely learnt a lot about the map creation, how by using a .txt file you can create the level and just easily edit it by editing the .txt file.
								Usually, I would’ve created a 2D array for the map, but in this case, I would’ve had to create a 21x21 array which is extremely big, and would’ve made
								 things a lot more confusing. By learning from the Platformer frame work, as well as using the programmer tricks up my sleeve, I was able to create
								 a pacman map from a .txt file.<br>
								<br>
								<h3>One key area you found difficult and want to learn more about?</h3>
								There was no particular part of the project which I found extremely difficult, the conversion from a .txt file to create a map was something new to me,
								but it didn’t take long to understand how it works. However, one thing that was a pain was that the arrays in C++ are static, unlike the dynamic ones
								in JavaScript. This made things harder for me, as I find that the dynamic arrays are much easier to work with, and I’m just a lot more used to them.
								Another thing, is that Pointers can be extremely confusing for me, I still don’t fully understand them – they’re unlike anything I’ve ever came across
								in my programming career.<br>
