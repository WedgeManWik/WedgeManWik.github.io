										<h2>Profile</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Programming is something I’ve been very passionate about ever since making my very first “Hello World” program; it’s something which I can look forward to
										 doing and enjoy getting better at. It never fails to motivate me when I finally see a project come to life after spending multiple hours on developing it,
										 it feels just as rewarding no matter how many times It happens.</p>
										 <br>
										 <p>I’m a first-year student at Staffordshire University, studying Computer Games Development. In this first year of study, I have learnt the basics of C++ and
										 Object-Oriented Programming, and have created a fully working Pacman program, as well as a Super Mario Arcade game and many other mini programs for various
										 problem-solving tasks I was assigned. Although I don’t have the most experience with C++, I’m always enthusiastic to learn new things and get better at what
										 I need improvement in. Improving my C++ Skill-tree and adding new programming tricks into my inventory is something which I would love to gain at Rebellion,
										 as well as getting to meet, join and build connections with a friendly and supportive game development team. Joining a Game Development team has been a dream
										 of mine ever since making my first 2D game in Python, it’s the next step on my Games Developer quest!</p>
										 <br>
										 <p>Throughout my time in education I have acquired various skills and qualities like confidence, teamwork and excellent communication, which help me in a programming
										 environment. As well as this, my hard work and determination is something which allows me to excel in my skills, and improve in areas which I want to get better at.

									<p>From studying A Level Further Mathematics and A Level Computer Science I have acquired lots of knowledge about Object Oriented Programming, Kinematics,
										Vectors and Objects in motion which helps me to program simple video games. Coming across complicated mathematical problems whilst designing a game,
										and trying to solve them in the quickest and most efficient way is something which I love coming across whenever I’m coding. Trying to solve the problem myself,
										and making up my own method using previous experience with similar problems is what makes me progress; and then later learning a more efficient solution from
										 someone who has more expertise, is what gives me the extra boost to help me retain the knowledge and learn from my mistakes</p>

													 <h2>Games Industry Experience</h2>
												 </header>
												 <p>Gaming in my spare time is something I’ve been doing for most of my life, not only is it something I enjoy doing, but it also gives me
													  an opportunity to learn from popular and successful Game Companies. By taking inspiration from them and trying to implement features
														 from their projects into my games, I can learn and develop my programming skills - Adapting those features, tweaking them and changing
														  them to my own liking is something that gives me the ace up my sleeve whenever I come across a programming problem that I came across
															 in a similar game I made a while ago.</p>
															 <br>
													<p>In my spare time at college, designing new ideas for games and then developing them is something which helped me improve my creativity,
														 coding skills and programming techniques.
														 Teamwork is something which goes a long way, no matter in what task is at hand. In the first week of university, all the Games Technology
														 students took part in a Game Jam, and so I was put into a group of five people. Communication and teamwork were something which helped us
														  to work together and make a game which we desired. The process of helping each other, as well as planning and working with each other as
															 a team is something which allowed us to build a friendly environment and build friendships – it boosted our performance and sped up the
															  development of the game, which was essential as we only had a one-week deadline to complete the game.</p>

													<h2>Employment</h2>

												<h3> Burger King </h3>

												<h4> Kitchen Staff - Crew Member [June 2021 - now] </h4>

												<p> Overview: </p>

												<p> My previous job was at Burger King in Colchester where I worked part-time. The thing I loved most was leaving the customer satisfied with
													their experience, with a big smile on their face and a want to come back another time for a repurchase. Making people feel like they aren’t “just another
													 customer” was an essential part of making their experience enjoyable. I gained a lot of work experience and various different skills such as great team-working
													 and leadership skills. As well as this, I was very quick to learn all the different burger types, side meals, proper procedures and ways to prepare all the
													  condiments. Making sure the food I was preparing had the expected quality, presentation and temperature, as well as it being delivered to the customer as
														 quickly as possible were all big responsibilities which I took on, to make sure the customer left satisfied </p>

												<p> responsibilities: </p>

												<p> As a kitchen staff I had to make sure all the food was being prepared safely and that there was no cross-contamination or unwanted objects in the meals prepared. I made sure the food I was preparing had the expected quality, presentation and temperature, as well as it being delivered to the customer as quickly as possible. Communication with my team was key to getting everything completed quickly and correctly, and so I developed very good communication skills as well as confidence throughout my time at Burger King. </p>

												<header class="major">
													<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
												</header>

												<p> Some of my other hobbies and interests apart from gaming include rock climbing, exercising at the gym, and playing guitar. These are things which I
													 love to do in my spare time.</p>
													 <p>Rock climbing allows me to connect with my friends, and by sharing our ideas and solutions for a particular route which we’re each finding difficult, we can try and come up with a
 												 solution for how to conquer a difficult course. The social collaboration and interaction, excitement of finally being able to climb a difficult route and finish it, and the physical
  										 challenge are what makes it so fun.</p>
											 <p>Exercise at the gym helps me to relax and relieve stress, as well as improve my physical strength. Setting goals and deadlines, as well as going consistently every week is what helps
 										 me discipline myself and make sure I stick to a good routine. Additionally, seeing improvement over the months is a real reward for the hard work – and proves to me that it’s worth it.</p>
										 <p>
											 Guitar is something that helps me with my creativity – it’s something chill that doesn’t take too much time and I can fit in-between big, time consuming tasks. I usually use it as a
 									 break whenever I’m doing coursework for multiple hours or some other brain demanding task. </p>
