										<h2>Profile</h2>
									</header>

									<p>Programming is something I’ve been very passionate about ever since making my very first “Hello World” program; it’s something which I can look forward to doing
										 and enjoy getting better at. It never fails to motivate me when I finally see a project come to life after spending multiple hours on developing it, it feels just
										  as rewarding no matter how many times It happens.</p>
										 <br>
										 <p>I’m a second-year student at Staffordshire University, studying Computer Games Development. In my first year of study, I learnt the basics of C++ and Object-Oriented
											  Programming, and have created a fully working Pacman program, a Super Mario Bros Arcade game and a 3D First-Person Shooter Aim trainer using OpenGL. All these
												projects and more can be viewed on my portfolio. Now that I’m moving onto my second year where I’ll be learning how to use game engines such as Unity and Unreal 5,
												and I’m ready to take the next step forward into developing bigger and better games.
												Although I don’t have the most experience with creating games, I’m always enthusiastic to learn new things and get better at what I need improvement in. Improving my
												 programming Skill-tree and adding new programming tricks into my inventory is something which I’m always looking forward to gain, as well as getting to meet, join
												 and build connections with other game developers and people with interests in the games industry. Joining a Game Development team has been a dream of mine ever
												 since making my first 2D game in Python, it’s the next step on my Games Developer quest!</p>
										 <br>
										 <p>Throughout my time in education I have acquired various skills and qualities like confidence, teamwork and excellent communication, which help me in a programming
											 environment. As well as this, my hard work and determination is something which allows me to excel in my skills, and improve in areas which I want to get better at.

									<p>From studying A Level Further Mathematics and A Level Computer Science I have acquired lots of knowledge about Object Oriented Programming, Kinematics,
										Vectors and Objects in motion which helps me to program simple video games. Coming across complicated mathematical problems whilst designing a game,
										and trying to solve them in the quickest and most efficient way is something which I love coming across whenever I’m coding. Trying to solve the problem myself,
										and making up my own method using previous experience with similar problems is what makes me progress; and then later learning a more efficient solution from
										 someone who has more expertise, is what gives me the extra boost to help me retain the knowledge and learn from my mistakes</p>

													 <h2>Relevant Games Industry Experience</h2>
												 </header>
												 <p>Gaming in my spare time is something I’ve been doing for most of my life, not only is it something I enjoy doing, but it also gives me
													  an opportunity to learn from popular and successful Game Companies. By taking inspiration from them and trying to implement features
														 from their projects into my games, I can learn and develop my programming skills - Adapting those features, tweaking them and changing
														  them to my own liking is something that gives me the ace up my sleeve whenever I come across a programming problem that I came across
															 in a similar game I made a while ago.</p>
															 <br>
													<p>In my spare time at college, designing new ideas for games and then developing them is something which helped me improve my creativity,
														 coding skills and programming techniques.
														 Over the summer, I have been creating an Indie game in Unreal Engine 5. This is a game which I’ve been wanting to make for a very long time
														  and have finally started to get good progress on. At the moment, It’s still in very early stages of development but I’m hoping to eventually
															 release it when it’s ready! I am constantly posting my progress of it on LinkedIn and twitter.
														 Teamwork is something which goes a long way, no matter in what task is at hand. In the first week of university, all the Games Technology
														 students took part in a Game Jam, and so I was put into a group of five people. Communication and teamwork were something which helped us
														  to work together and make a game which we desired. The process of helping each other, as well as planning and working with each other as
															 a team is something which allowed us to build a friendly environment and build friendships – it boosted our performance and sped up the
															  development of the game, which was essential as we only had a one-week deadline to complete the game.</p>

													<h2>Employment</h2>
												</header>

												<h3> Burger King </h3>

												<h4> Kitchen Staff [June 2021 - June 2022] </h4>

												<h3> McDonald's </h3>

												<h4> Crew Member [June 2022 - present] </h4>

												<p> Overview: </p>

												<p> Leaving the customer satisfied with their experience, with a big smile on their face and a want to come back another time for a repurchase
													 is the best feeling I’ve experienced through working at these jobs. Making people feel like they aren’t “just another customer” was an essential
													  part of making their experience enjoyable. I gained a lot of various skills such as great team-working, communication and leadership skills.
														As well as this, I was very quick to learn all the recipes, proper procedures and ways to prepare all the condiments. Making sure the food I
														was preparing had the expected quality, presentation and temperature, as well as it being delivered to the customer as quickly as possible were
														 all big responsibilities which I took on, to make sure the customer left satisfied and happy with their purchase. </p>

												<p> responsibilities: </p>

												<p> As a kitchen staff I had to make sure all the food was being prepared safely and that there was no cross-contamination or unwanted objects in
													 the meals prepared. I made sure the food I was preparing had the expected quality, presentation and temperature, as well as it being delivered to
													  the customer as quickly as possible. Communication with my team was key to getting everything completed quickly and correctly, and so I developed
														 very good communication skills as well as confidence due to this. </p>

												<header class="major">
													<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
												</header>

												<p> Some of my other hobbies and interests apart from gaming include rock climbing, exercising at the gym, and playing guitar. These are things which I
													 love to do in my spare time.</p>
													 <p>Rock climbing allows me to connect with my friends, and by sharing our ideas and solutions for a particular route which we’re each finding difficult, we can try and come up with a
 												 solution for how to conquer a difficult course. The social collaboration and interaction, excitement of finally being able to climb a difficult route and finish it, and the physical
  										 challenge are what makes it so fun.</p>
											 <p>Exercise at the gym helps me to relax and relieve stress, as well as improve my physical strength. Setting goals and deadlines, as well as going consistently every week is what helps
 										 me discipline myself and make sure I stick to a good routine. Additionally, seeing improvement over the months is a real reward for the hard work – and proves to me that it’s worth it.</p>
										 <p>
											 Guitar is something that helps me with my creativity – it’s something chill that doesn’t take too much time and I can fit in-between big, time consuming tasks. I usually use it as a
 									 break whenever I’m doing coursework for multiple hours or some other brain demanding task. </p>
