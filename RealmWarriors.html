												<h2> Overview </h2>
												<p> Realm Warriors is a Multiplayer Top-Down Third person co-op survival game targeted for PC, using keyboard and mouse controls. The game features a single player mode as well as a multiplayer mode. When a player has joined a lobby, they are able to select which character they want to play as. The host can then start the match.  
													Each playable character has unique stats and abilities, meaning the players have to work together and use their character’s strengths together to kill enemies and survive. The players are able to play as the same characters, and will face swarms of enemies as they try and get through the challenging game map. As the players progress, the enemies will get stronger and start to spawn more frequently as the game goes on. Depending on how many players are in the game, a suitable number of enemies will be spawned so that the difficulty remains the same no matter how many players have joined the session. Once the players have reached the end of the map, a boss enemy will spawn which the players will have to defeat to complete the game.  
													The players will each have a maximum health amount based on which character they select. If they reach 0 health, they will be downed - in this state, they cannot attack or move. Another player can then come and revive the downed player to get them back into action. If all the players are in the downed state, they lose the game. When an enemy is killed, the player gains XP (experience). This XP will allow players to level up once they have collected enough of it – which will increase the player’s maximum health and damage on each attack. 
													To end the game the players can win by getting through the map, going all the way to the end and defeating the final boss, lose by having all players in the downed state, or they can quit the match. 	</p>

												<h2> What I learnt during this project </h2>
												<p> This was my first ever attempt at creating a multiplayer game. Unfortunately, I was not able to get it working over a WAN, however, it was still a great learning experience which helped me learn a lot about the creation of how multiplayers game work. I learned multiplayer techniques such as replication and remote procedure calls to allow the clients and server to communicate and share the same experience on their screens. This game was also the first ever game which I have created where there is more than one playable character, so learning how to implement such a feature was also a fun challenge and learning experience.</p>									
												<p> The knowledge gained from this project has helped me want to start making more multiplayer games, and has enlightened me on the difficulties involved with creating multiplayer games, but also how fun they are to make. This project has inspired me to start working on more multiplayer games in the future.</p>
